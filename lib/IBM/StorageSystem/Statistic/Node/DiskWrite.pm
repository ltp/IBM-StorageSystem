=head1 NAME

IBM::StorageSystem::Statistic::Node::DiskWrite - Utility class for IBM::StorageSystem node disk write statistics

=head1 SYNOPSIS

IBM::StorageSystem::Statistic::Node::DiskWrite - Utility class for IBM::StorageSystem node disk write statistics.

An IBM::StorageSystem::Statistic::Node::DiskWrite object represents a collection of statistical measurements for
disk write operations for the specified node during a single interval period.  

The interval period is defined by the interval parameter passed on invocation to the specific parent class.

=head1 METHODS

=head3 start_time 

The start time of the interval over which the data was collected in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC+HH'.

=head3 end_time 

The end time of the interval over which the data was collected in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC+HH'.

=head1 DATA METHODS

=head3 device_n 

Returns the write operations for the specified device.

B<Note> that the method name B<device_n> used above is a variable method name that is dynamically created
dependent on the system type and architecture.  

The device name will be the same as the system device name
to which GPFS disks are mapped - for example; for SONAS IBM storage system architectures, GPFS disks are 
mapped to multipath devices (/dev/dm-*) and so for each multipath devicemapper device, a new method will be 
created using the device name.

	# For example; to retrieve a list of the device names (and hence, the methods available),
	# invoke the 'values' method on the IBM::StorageSystem::StatisticsSet object retrieved
	# from a 'disk_writes' invocation;

	my $writes = $ibm->node('mgmt001st001')->disk_writess;
	print "Methods available:\n", join "\n", sort $write_stats->values;

	# Prints:
	# Methods available:
	# dm_0
	# dm_1
	# dm_10
	# dm_11
	# dm_12
	# dm_13
	# ...

B<Note> that any hyphens in the device name will be replaced by an underscore.
